```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy sqlite3 pygame pillow
```

### 2. Add Known Faces

Place clear front-facing photos in the `People/` directory:

```
People/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ john_doe.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jane_smith.jpg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security_guard.jpg
```

**Image Requirements:**

- Clear, front-facing photos
- Good lighting
- Single person per image
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG
- Filename becomes the person's name

### 3. Run the System

```bash
# Standard face recognition (optimized for performance)
python main_face_recognition.py

# The system now runs in CONSTANT DETECTION MODE by default:
# - Processes every frame with no delays
# - Instant face recognition on every camera frame
# - No capture intervals or sound delays
# - Maximum responsiveness for real-time applications
```

### 4. Camera Controls

- **'q'** - Quit the system
- **'s'** - Save current frame manually
- **'c'** - Capture current frame for training
- **'u'** - List unknown faces
- **'v'** - Show visit statistics
- **'r'** - Generate activity report

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Camera Settings

```python
# In main_face_recognition.py
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change index for different cameras
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 1280)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 720)
```

### Recognition Thresholds

```python
face_distance_threshold = 0.6    # Lower = stricter recognition
unknown_threshold = 0.5          # Threshold for unknown face matching
```

### Timing Settings (Constant Detection Mode)

```python
capture_interval = 0             # Continuous capture (no delays)
sound_interval = 0               # Continuous sound notifications
min_detection_duration = 0       # Instant logging (no minimum time)
process_every_n_frames = 1       # Process every single frame
```

**Performance Optimizations:**

- **Zero Delays**: All timing intervals set to 0 for maximum responsiveness
- **Every Frame Processing**: No frame skipping for constant detection
- **Instant Logging**: Immediate activity recording
- **Real-time Audio**: Continuous sound feedback
  sound_interval = 5 # Seconds between sound notifications
  min_detection_duration = 2 # Minimum seconds before logging visit

## üéÆ Usage Modes

### Live Camera Mode (Default)

```bash
python main_face_recognition.py
````

### Command Line Options

```bash
python main_face_recognition.py --camera 1           # Use camera index 1
python main_face_recognition.py --mode report        # Generate report only
python main_face_recognition.py --mode stats         # Show statistics
```

## üìä Database Schema

The system creates several tables in `parking_system.db`:

### Known Faces

- Person name and face encoding
- Creation and update timestamps
- Activity status

### Unknown Faces

- Face encodings and assigned temporary names
- First seen and last seen timestamps
- Visit count tracking

### Activity Log

- All face detection events
- Confidence scores and timestamps
- Image paths for review

### Visits

- Complete visit sessions with duration
- Entry and exit tracking
- Statistical analysis data

## üîß Advanced Features

### Unknown Face Management

The system automatically:

- Detects and tracks unknown faces
- Assigns temporary names (Unknown_001, Unknown_002, etc.)
- Groups similar unknown faces
- Provides tools to convert unknown faces to known faces

### Audio Feedback

- **Known Face Detected**: Pleasant notification sound
- **Unknown Face Detected**: Alert notification sound
- Configurable volume and sound files

### Activity Reports

Generate comprehensive reports including:

- Daily/weekly/monthly summaries
- Most frequent visitors
- Peak activity times
- Visit duration statistics

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No Faces Detected

- Check camera permissions
- Ensure good lighting
- Verify camera index (try 0, 1, 2)
- Check if other applications are using the camera

### Poor Recognition Accuracy

- Use high-quality, well-lit photos for known faces
- Ensure faces are front-facing in training images
- Adjust `face_distance_threshold` (lower = stricter)
- Add multiple photos per person

### Performance Issues

- Reduce camera resolution
- Use HOG model instead of CNN (faster but less accurate)
- Close other applications using the camera

## üîå Integration API

For integration with other systems:

```python
from main_face_recognition import recognize_face_id

# Simple recognition function
def check_face_authorization(frame):
    face_name = recognize_face_id(frame)
    return face_name is not None, face_name
```

## üìù Example Integration

```python
import cv2
from main_face_recognition import recognize_face_id

# Capture frame
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
ret, frame = cap.read()

# Recognize face
face_name = recognize_face_id(frame)

if face_name:
    print(f"Authorized person detected: {face_name}")
else:
    print("No authorized person detected")

cap.release()
```

## üéØ Performance Metrics

**Typical Performance:**

- **Recognition Speed**: 100-300ms per frame
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ with good training images
- **False Positives**: <2% with proper threshold tuning
- **Database**: Handles 1000+ faces efficiently

## üîê Security Features

- Face encodings are stored (not actual images)
- Automatic activity logging
- Tamper detection for training images
- Configurable access levels

## üì± Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multiple camera support
- [ ] Web interface for management
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Cloud synchronization
- [ ] Real-time alerts system
