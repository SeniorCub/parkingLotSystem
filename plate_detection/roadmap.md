Absolutely! Here's a **focused 1-week roadmap** to help you complete the **Plate Number Detection Model** training using **YOLOv8** — with **daily tasks**, tools, and clear deliverables. This assumes you have **basic Python/OpenCV experience** and access to **Google Colab**.

---

## 🗺️ PLATE NUMBER DETECTION — 1 WEEK ROADMAP

### 🎯 Goal:

Train and export a custom YOLOv8 model that accurately detects Nigerian license plates.

---

## ✅ TOOLS NEEDED

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) or [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
* Dataset of Nigerian car images
* `ultralytics` Python package (for YOLOv8)

---

## 📅 DAY-BY-DAY PLAN

---

### **📍 DAY 1 — Setup + Data Collection**

**Goal:** Prepare your project folder and collect sample images.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Create folder: `PlateYOLOData/`
* Collect **200–300 images** of Nigerian vehicles showing license plates.

  * Take photos or download public images
  * Save in `PlateYOLOData/images/`

📦 **Deliverable:** At least 200 labeled images in `images/` folder.

---

### **📍 DAY 2 — Annotate Plates**

**Goal:** Label the license plates in all images.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) (recommended) or install [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
* Annotate **only** the plate region in each image
* Export in **YOLOv8 format** (images + `.txt` labels)

📦 **Deliverable:** Your dataset should now have:

```
PlateYOLOData/
├── images/
├── labels/
```

---

### **📍 DAY 3 — Organize Dataset + Upload to Colab**

**Goal:** Prepare dataset and start Google Colab environment.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Split data: 80% train, 20% val
  (Roboflow can help you do this automatically)
* Upload dataset to Google Drive or directly to Colab as a ZIP
* Create `data.yaml` in Colab:

  ```yaml
  train: /content/dataset/images/train
  val: /content/dataset/images/val
  nc: 1
  names: ['license_plate']
  ```

📦 **Deliverable:** Dataset loaded in Colab + YAML ready

---

### **📍 DAY 4 — Train YOLOv8 Model in Colab**

**Goal:** Train the custom YOLOv8 model.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Install ultralytics in Colab:

  ```python
  !pip install ultralytics
  ```
* Start training:

  ```python
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")
  model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640)
  ```
* Monitor performance (look at loss, mAP, precision/recall)

📦 **Deliverable:** Trained model `best.pt` in `runs/detect/...`

---

### **📍 DAY 5 — Evaluate + Download Model**

**Goal:** Test your model and download it for local use.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Run:

  ```python
  model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")
  model.predict("test_image.jpg", save=True)
  ```
* Download `best.pt`:

  ```python
  from google.colab import files
  files.download('/content/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt')
  ```

📦 **Deliverable:** Exported `best.pt` for use locally

---

### **📍 DAY 6 — Integrate Locally + Detection Script**

**Goal:** Test detection in a Python script on your laptop.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Use OpenCV to load images or video
* Use:

  ```python
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  model = YOLO("plate_model.pt")
  result = model.predict(frame)
  ```
* Draw bounding boxes around detected plates

📦 **Deliverable:** Working `plate_recognition.py` with detection on video/images

---

### **📍 DAY 7 — Crop Plate + OCR (Prep for Matching Phase)**

**Goal:** Crop the detected plate and extract text using OCR.

🔧 **Tasks:**

* Extract coordinates from YOLO output
* Crop plate region
* Use `EasyOCR` or `Tesseract`:

  ```python
  import easyocr
  reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
  text = reader.readtext(cropped_plate)
  ```

📦 **Deliverable:** Text extracted from detected plate

---

## 🏁 FINAL OUTPUT

By Day 7, you should have:

✅ Trained YOLOv8 model (`plate_model.pt`)
✅ `plate_recognition.py` script
✅ Plate detection working on live video
✅ Text extraction with OCR (ready for database matching)

---

If you’d like, I can help scaffold your `plate_recognition.py` and `utils.py` with YOLO detection + OCR + database logging too.
